Marcus gripped the iron bar with heavy tongs, thrusting it deep into the furnace until the metal blazed orange like a captured sunset. Sweat beaded on his weathered brow as he withdrew the glowing steel and positioned it on the anvil's scarred surface.\n\nHis hammer fell in measured strikes, each blow sending sparks cascading to the dirt floor. The metal sang under the rhythmic pounding, gradually lengthening and flattening as he worked from tang to tip. Steam hissed when he plunged the blade into the quenching tub, the water roiling violently around the cherry-red steel.\n\nThe acrid smell of hot metal and coal smoke filled his nostrils. His calloused hands, black with soot and forge scale, moved with practiced precision as he returned the blade to the fire. The steel's color shifted from silver to straw yellow as he tempered it, drawing out the brittleness. Hours passed before he finally set down his tools, examining the straight, true edge that would serve its wielder well.",

The rhythmic percussion echoed off the soot-stained walls.\n\nWhen the metal cooled to dull orange, Marcus thrust it back into the forge's hungry mouth.

The steel flattened and stretched under the relentless percussion, gradually taking the shape of a blade.\n\nSweat beaded on his forehead despite the cool morning air.
